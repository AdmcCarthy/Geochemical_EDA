Getting the data
----------------

Geoscience Australlia `Petroleum Wells <http://dbforms.ga.gov.au/www/npm.well.search>`_ provides open access to the borehole well data.

The dataset is hosted under a creative commons `Attribution 3.0 Australia (CC BY 3.0 AU) <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en>`_

View the `copyright and disclaimer <http://www.ga.gov.au/copyright>`_ notice for information before downloading.

The process can not be automated as there is only a limited api to the website. You will need to select a range of wells, check the "Organic Geochemistry"
and then click "Submit Query". The results can be saved as a csv. It may be neccesary to copy all of the information from the resulting web page
to a text file to create the csv.

The figure shows all wells with hydrocarbon shows in Geoscience Australia's data set.
